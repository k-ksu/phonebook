The code had to meet these conditions:

Built-in sorting algorithms are not allowed, developers have to implement sorting themselves if needed.

Unless stated otherwise, any algorithm/data structure can be used to solve the exercise, as long as it is implemented by the developer.

You must declare a generic Map ADT or Set ADT in a form of an abstract class or an interface.

You must provide and use a generic implementation of Map or Set using hash tables.

You must implement either separate chaining or open addressing.

You may implement a hash table without resizing (throwing an exception when a hashtable is full).
